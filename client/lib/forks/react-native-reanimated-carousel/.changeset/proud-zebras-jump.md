feat: use new RNGH api

Updates `react-native-gesture-handler` to `>=2.9.0` and replaces usage of `useAnimatedGestureHandler` with the [new gesture handler API](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/#rngh-20) which supports the [new gesture handler web implementation](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/pull/2157).
