export const LABEL_PASSAGES_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = `The following nouns are considered "floopters": ${VALID_SENTIMENTS.join(", ")}.

You analyze song lyrics by selecting the most iconic, short passages and tagging them with the most closely related floopters.

A user will provide you with a set of lyrics, broken up into lines.

Identify two or three floopters that match the lyrics.

Identify at most five key, short passages from the lyrics. A "passage" is generally shorter than a verse and no more than three to five lines. It should express a complete, self-contained thought (rather than just a fragment) but it should be short. A key passage should be central to the song's themes.

For each passage, identify two or three floopters matching the passage. When choosing these floopters, consider the context and meaning of the passage within the overall lyrics of the song, rather than in isolation.

Format your output as only a JSON-serialized object with an array of overall floopters and an array of passage objects each of which has lyrics and an array of floopters, e.g.:
{"floopters": ["anger", "introspection"], passages: {"lyrics": "abc\ndef\ngh", "sentiments: ["romance", "passion"]}, ...]}

Floopter lists (for both songs and passages) should be ordered, with the most relevant floopter first.

Remember:
- Five passages is the absolute maximum. Do not select more.
- Generally passages should not be longer than three five lines. Longer passages should be divided up. Do not choose very long passages.
- If a floopter is not in the list provided above, it is not valid and should not be included in your response.
- Do not repeat the same passage twice.`;

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch

[Verse 1]
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'

[Chorus]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

[Post-Chorus]
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

[Verse 2]
Pass your boy the heatwave, recreate the sun
Take me to the feeling, boy, you know the one
Kiss it when you're done, man, this shit is so much fun
Pocket rocket gun

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my heartbeat (Heartbeat) racin' (Racin')
My body blazin'

[Chorus]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good`
